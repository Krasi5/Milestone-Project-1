README
GymPlus is a fitness-oriented site, created as a Milestone Project 1 for a Web Development course. It is designed as an alternative to well-known labels to give the best experience to its users.
The aim is to provide a range of physical exercises, in a friendly environment with support of individual's abilities. Proper nutrition is a part of physical and mental well-being as well as the opportunity to accommodate the needs of the young family members, while the people exercising.

User Experience

From the user's perspective, I want to be able to access the site from different devices.
As a user, I want to navigate quickly through the site and familiarise myself with the options offered.
As a user, I want to find easily the information I need, to choose a service.
As a user, I need to know what people say about the club.
As a user, I want to book a service quickly and easily.

   

Colour Scheme

Gold and gray colors are the foundation of the site.
Health is precious like gold, gray color was chosen as a gentle contrast, less stressful than black.

Wireframes

   Balsamiq Wireframe was used to produce wireframes. At this stage I am not able to upload pictures of wireframes into the readme file.


   Features

   Navigation Bar 
   
It consists of a logo sign and three pages - Home, Features, and Testimonials plus the Sign In button, which gives a connection to the required information. It is responsive to different viewports and  accommodates the minimal space. The bar changes to a hamburger icon in small devices and collapses to allow access. I wanted and tried to change it to gold color, however I did not manage to overcome the anchor tag to do it.


Landing page

It consists of a picture with the motto, which conveys the purpose of the site. 
There is an advertise, encouraging the visitors to have a trial. The Sign Up button open a box for personal details.
  

Features page 

It represents the services provided, divided into four sections. A picture was used to provide the corresponding color and make the page more interesting. 

Testimonials 

The page presents the opinions of four people. The text was wrapped in rectangles in an order different than the previous page which was a problem in a smaller size as the height was set at 60vh.


Responsivness
The site was created to be responsive on various devices: mobile phone, tablet, desktop
